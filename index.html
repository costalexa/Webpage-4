    <h1 id="box1">A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
    <b>Helena:</b> O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
    To set against me for your merriment:
    If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
    You would not do me thus much injury.
    Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
    But you must join in souls to mock me too?
    If you were men, as men you are in show,
    You would not use a gentle lady so;
    To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
    When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
    You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
    And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
    A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
    To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
    With your derision! none of noble sort
    Would so offend a virgin, and extort
    A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

    <h1 id="box2">As You Like It</h1>
    <b>Rosalind:</b> Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house
    and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and
    cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.
    Yet I profess curing it by counsel. (Orlando: Did you ever cure any so?)
    Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress;
    and I set him every day to woo me: at which time would I, being but a
    moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking; proud,
    fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles,
    for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
    women are, for the most part, cattle of this colour; would now like him,
    now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him,
    then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a
    living humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the
    world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him; and
    this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
    heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.

    <h1 id="box3">Measure for Measure</h1>
    <b>Isabella:</b> O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
    Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
    Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
    From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
    Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
    For such a warped slip of wilderness
    Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
    Die, perish! Might but my bending down
    Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
    I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
    No word to save thee.
    </div>
  <div id="content-box">
    <h1 id="box4">The Tempest</h1>
    <b>Ariel:</b> I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
    So fun of valour that they smote the air
    For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
    For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
    Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
    At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,
    Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
    As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
    That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
    Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
    Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
    I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
    There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
    O'erstunk their feet
    </div>
  <div id="content-box">
    <h1 id="box5">King Lear</h1>
    <b>Cordelia:</b> Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
    My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty
    According to my bond; no more nor less.
    Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me;
    I Return those duties back as are right fit,
    Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
    Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
    They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
    That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
    Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
    Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
    To love my father all.
